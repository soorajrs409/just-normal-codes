keylogger.py is the source code for a keylogger that will send the reports to email.

The code can be easily modified eg: the smtp server can be changed , time interval and even the reports can be sent to server with very small modifications

The file keylogger.py can be converted to exe files for windows using py2exe or pyinstaller

The exe files can be merged with images or pdf easily. There are lot of tutorials for this on internet

NOTE: use a combination of tools with keylogger for being safe like TOR proxies, macchangers and temp mails without phone numbers.
